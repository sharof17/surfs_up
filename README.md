# Surfs_up

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is analysis is to see temperature statistics for June and December to see if running a surf shop is sustainable year around. The way we get the temperature data is by running two seperate queries, one being for June and the other being December. 

## Results

_June Statistics for the Temperature and Precipitation

_December Statistics for the Temperature and Precipitation

![December](Resources/decemberdesc.png)

The tables above show the weather patterns for June and December.
  
- Average temperature between June and December is 75 and 71 degrees respectively. And the precipitation average is 0.22 inches and 0.14 inches in December and June, respectevely. 
- The maximum temperatures of 85 (June) and 83 (December) are also almost similar.
- The minimum temperature of 56 (December) and 64 (June) show the greatest variance, and shows much lower temperature level in December. 
- However, with standard deviations of 3.25 (June) and 3.74 (December) we would expect a little more variation in the december numbers.

## Summary

To sum up it is important to say that the weather in December and June is very similar. The maximums of the month are very close to each other. However, the minimum of December is much lower than June's.

*Additional queries included:*
- Percipitation level of June
- Percipitation level of December

Precipation difference between June and December to determine is one has more rainy weather, as well as a comaparison by weather station, as we may see higher/lower temperatures and precipitation levels at different locations. We would be primarily interested in the weather station closest to our prospective location, which would narrow the results and provide the best data for us to consider.
